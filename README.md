## Setup Instructions <a id='setup-instructions'></a>

### Installation <a id='installation'></a>

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CuAuPro/alpr-system.git
    cd alpr-system
    ```

2. Setup backend:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```

3. Setup frontend:

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ng build --configuration=production
    ```

4. Setup MQTT (for additional requirements)

    ```bash
    cd ../databus
    # Follow instructions in mqtt/README.md
    ```

5. Setup Python AI scripts (for additional requirements):

    ```bash
    cd ../ai-engine
    # Follow instructions in ai-engine/README.md
    ```

6. Setup Python GPIO scripts (for additional requirements):

    ```bash
    cd ../gpio-handler
    # Follow instructions in gpio-handler/README.md
    ```

## Components <a id='components'></a>

### Backend <a id='backend'></a>

For detailed instructions on backend setup and usage, refer to `backend/README.md`.

### Frontend <a id='frontend'></a>

For detailed instructions on frontend setup and usage, refer to `frontend/README.md`.

### Databus <a id='databus'></a>

For detailed instructions on Databus setup and usage, refer to `databus/README.md`.

### Python AI <a id='ai-engine'></a>

For detailed instructions on AI setup and usage, refer to `ai-engine/README.md`.

### Python GPIO <a id='gpio-handler'></a>

For detailed instructions on GPIO setup and usage, refer to `gpio-handler/README.md`.

## Environment Variables <a id='environment-variables'></a>

Create a `dev.env` file in the `backend/env` directory with the following contents:

```bash
NODEJS="DEVEL"
PORT=443
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

Create a `prod.env` file in the backend/env directory with the following contents:

```bash
NODEJS="PROD"
PORT=443
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

## Docker <a id='docker'></a>

Dockerfiles are provided for both the backend and frontend components. You can use Docker Compose to easily build and
run the entire system in containers.

Docker's `default-runtime` to `nvidia`, so that the NVCC compiler and GPU are available during `docker build` operations.  Add `"default-runtime": "nvidia"` to your `/etc/docker/daemon.json` configuration file before attempting to build the containers:

``` json
{
    "runtimes": {
        "nvidia": {
            "path": "nvidia-container-runtime",
            "runtimeArgs": []
        }
    },

    "default-runtime": "nvidia"
}
```

Then restart the Docker service, or reboot your system before proceeding:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl restart docker
```

You can then confirm the changes by looking under `docker info`

```bash
$ sudo docker info | grep 'Default Runtime'
Default Runtime: nvidia
```

You also need to create persistend database file. To create a directory in and set up a volume for the backend alpr.db,
follow these steps:

1. Create Directory: Open a terminal and run the following command to create a directory named `alpr-system`
   in `/var/opt/docker/database`:

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /var/opt/docker/alpr-system/database
    ```

2. Copy initialized `alpr.db` to `/var/opt/docker/alpr-system/database`.

3. Set Up Volume: After creating the directory, you can specify a volume for the backend alpr.db in your Docker Compose
   file. Add the following volume configuration under the backend service in your `docker-compose.yml` file:

    ```yaml
    volumes:
      - /var/opt/docker/alpr-system/database:/app/backend/database
    ```

To start the application using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
